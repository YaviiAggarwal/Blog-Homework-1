                    <p class="text-muted text-left">A Sunday school is an educational institution, usually (but not always) Christian in character.

Sunday school classes usually precede a Sunday church service and are used to provide catechesis to Christians, especially children and teenagers, and often adults as well. Churches of many Christian denominations have classrooms attached to the church used for this purpose. Many Sunday school classes operate on a set curriculum, with some teaching attendees a catechism. Members often receive certificates and awards for participation, as well as attendance.

Due to the fact that Sunday school classes precede morning worship on the Lord's Day, many provide a light breakfast, such as doughnuts and coffee, except on days in which Holy Communion is being celebrated due to the fact that many Christian denominations encourage fasting before receiving the Eucharistic elements.[1]</p>

                    <p class="text-left">The Auditorium Theatre is a National Historic Landmark known internationally for its perfect acoustics, innovative architecture, and stunning design.

The idea for the Auditorium Theatre began with a Chicago businessman named Ferdinand Wythe Peck. He was dedicated to improving the city of Chicago, and after the Haymarket Square riot in 1886, he began plans for a structure he called the Auditorium Building. This structure included not only a theatre, but also an office block and a hotel.Peck envisioned a theatre that would be open to all Chicagoans, and incorporated Chicago Auditorium Association for the purpose of developing the worldâ€™s largest, grandest, most expensive building.

The famous architectural firm of Adler and Sullivan designed the theatre, which officially opened in 1889, using the most modern technology at the time, including electric lighting and air conditioning. They pushed the limits of modern architecture to make the Auditorium the then-tallest building in Chicago, the first multi-use building ever designed, and the most massive modern edifice in the world at the time.</p>
